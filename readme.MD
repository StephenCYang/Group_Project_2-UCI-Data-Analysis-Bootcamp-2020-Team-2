## Fantasy Soccer Dashboard

This dashboard will assist fantasy soccer players in managing their teams. It uses the API from https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/ that is updated regularly as the season progresses.

Such information about individual players and their overall stats, existing real life teams, and game performance will be displayed on a dashboard for easy analysis to identify which players are “hot” or not, and who should be rostered or benched for the next match.

## Roles
Project Manager - Brendan
Front End - McKenna
Back End - Isaac/Helma
Repo Manager/Utility - Stephen

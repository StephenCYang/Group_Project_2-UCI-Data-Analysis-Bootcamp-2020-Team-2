# Project 2 - Group 2 Proposal
Brendan Barrow, Isaac Carranza, Helma Zecena, McKenna Miranda, Stephen Yang

## Fantasy Soccer Dashboard

This dashboard will assist fantasy soccer players in managing their teams. It uses the API from https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/ that is updated regularly as the season progresses.

Such information about individual players and their overall stats, existing real life teams, and game performance will be displayed on a dashboard for easy analysis to identify which players are “hot” or not, and who should be rostered or benched for the next match.

## Roles
Project Manager/SME - Brendan

Front End - McKenna

Back End - Isaac/Helma

Repo Manager/Utilit - Stephen

## Progress
July 6 - Initial group division of labor and subject selection.

July 8 - Discussed what to pull out of the API that we're interested. Also found that someone created a Python wrapper for the FPL API. Added the wrapper's doc to the repo. Discussing if we'll use it or not.

July 11 - Discussed more about the dashboard pages, compared with the examples to see what we wanted.
